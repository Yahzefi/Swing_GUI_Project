# Project Description

A simple calculator application built using Java and the Swing GUI

## Overview

After learning some of basics/differences between Java and JavaScript, there was one constant in the courses I watched.  Every bit of output was through System.out.println().  This is fine for the purpose of understanding the general concepts of variable declarations, functions and classes, but it also bothered me.  I wanted to see what you could actually _create_ with Java.  I wanted to actually interact with something in a similar way as you would with a website built with JavaScript.  I figured it'd help me learn the inner working of the language that much more, so I decided to use Java's classic GUI.  The general consensus I noticed was although it's outdated, it's still a great learning tool.

## The Experience

This was the first application I made using Java, and it was also the first time trying to built and export it as a .jar file.  This was a much different process than the idea of setting up a domain in which could be used to host a web application.  It actually went a lot smoother than I expected, and I will include it in the project folder for anyone interested in testing it out for themselves.  I can tell there's an immense amount of concepts and features to utilize with Java, and I hope I can work on a project some day to explore the language even more.
