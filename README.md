# Project Description

A simple calculator application built using Java and the Swing GUI

## Overview

After learning some of basics/differences between Java and JavaScript, there was one constant in the courses I watched.  Every bit of output was through System.out.println().  This is fine for the purpose of understanding the general concepts of variable declarations, functions and classes, but it also bothered me.  I wanted to see what you could actually _create_ with Java.  I wanted to actually interact with something in a similar way as you would with a website built with JavaScript.  I figured it'd help me learn the inner working of the language that much more, so I decided to use Java's classic GUI.  The general consensus I noticed was although it's outdated, it's still a great learning tool.

## The Experience

I used the IntelliJ IDE, which was strange enough since I'd gotten so used to Visual Studio.  Although aside from some shortcut differences, it wasn't all too difficult to make the switch.  I'd written some basic Java code before, but it'd been a while since then and also since I'd used a strict object-oriented language.  After picking up the basics of the Swing GUI's features, I set up and added all of the components to the frame (application window).  This was extrememly easy, as it only came down to using the proper syntax for everything.  The moment I started to experience difficulties, however, was when I started to code the logic for adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing the inputted numbers.  I'm not sure I can pin down exactly what kept going wrong, but the overall feel of the project felt slightly different than JavaScript.  Of course not enough to really tell what was going wrong.  Thankfully, I eventually figured out a solution using an extra variable and by that point the project was essentially finished.

## Final Remarks

This was the first application I made using Java, and it was also the first time trying to built and export it as a .jar file.  This was a much different process than the idea of setting up a domain in which could be used to host a web application.  It actually went a lot smoother than I expected, and I will include it in the project folder for anyone interested in testing it out for themselves.  I can tell there's an immense amount of concepts and features to utilize with Java, and I hope I can work on a project some day to explore the language even more.
